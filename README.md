# Conference Central

This is the fourth project in my pursuit of the Full Stack Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Prior to starting this project I completed the
Udacity course entitled "Developing Scalable Apps in Python". The focus
of this project is leveraging the powerful Google App Engine framework,
including Cloud Endpoints and Datastore, to develop highly-scalable
applications with APIs that are accessible from a wide variety of devices.
Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"You will develop a cloud-based API server to support a provided conference
organization application that exists on the web as well as a native Android
application. The API supports the following functionality found within the
app: user authentication, user profiles, conference information and various
manners in which to query the data."


## Accessing the Application

To access the front-end of the application, visit the following link:

http://conference-central-123.appspot.com

From the landing page you can navigate to other pages which will allow you
to view, create and register for conferences. You will be prompted to log
in with your Google account before you're actually allowed to create a
conference or register to attend a conference. Keep in mind, all conferences
on this site are fictional. ;)
