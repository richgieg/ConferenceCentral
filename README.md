# Conference Central

This is the fourth project in my pursuit of the Full Stack Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"You will develop a cloud-based API server to support a provided conference
organization application that exists on the web as well as a native Android
application. The API supports the following functionality found within the
app: user authentication, user profiles, conference information and various
manners in which to query the data."
